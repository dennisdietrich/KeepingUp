## Presentation title
Keeping up with Rachel Appel and the Commodore

## Description
Imaging your wife has a great idea for a new talk featuring the legendary Commodore 64 and 40-year-old type-in programs in BASIC.
You agree to help by typing in said programs only to find that one spends over 15 seconds to draw a chess board.
Another spends over a minute just to zero out 19 kB of RAM.
Some just feel sluggish and slow to respond after initialization.
Surely that's boring to watch during a live demo. So what do you do?
Of course you start looking for ways to make things faster, but in the spirit of your wife's talk using only techniques available on actual hardware 40 years ago.
In this talk we'll look at what makes Commodore BASIC so painfully slow and a few ways to deal with it.
And since it's all about speed, we're doing it in a lightning talk instead of a two-day workshop.
